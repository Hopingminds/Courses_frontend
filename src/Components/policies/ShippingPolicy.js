        <h2>Shipping Information</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>What are the delivery charges?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Delivery charge varies with each Seller.</p>
        <p>
          Sellers incur relatively higher shipping costs on low value items. In
          such cases, charging a nominal delivery charge helps them offset
          logistics costs. Please check your order summary to understand the
          delivery charges for individual products.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Products listed as Grocify Plus, a Rs 40 charge for delivery per
          item may be applied if the order value is less than Rs 500. While,
          orders of Rs 500 or above are delivered free.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            Why does the delivery date not correspond to the delivery timeline
            of X-Y business days?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible that the Seller or our courier partners have a holiday
          between the day your placed your order and the date of delivery, which
          is based on the timelines shown on the product page. In this case, we
          add a day to the estimated date. Some courier partners and Sellers do
          not work on Sundays and this is factored in to the delivery dates.
        </p>
        <strong>What is the estimated delivery time?</strong>
        <p>
          Sellers generally procure and ship the items within the time specified
          on the product page. Business days exclude public holidays and
          Sundays.
        </p>
        <p>Estimated delivery time depends on the following factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Seller offering the product</li>
          <li>Product's availability with the Seller</li>
          <li>
            The destination to which you want the order shipped to and location
            of the Seller.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <strong>
          Are there any hidden costs on items sold by Sellers on Grocify?
        </strong>
        <p>
          There are NO hidden charges when you make a purchase on Grocify. List
          prices are final and all-inclusive. The price you see on the product
          page is exactly what you would pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delivery charges are not hidden charges and are charged (if at all)
          extra depending on the Seller's shipping policy.
        </p>

        <strong>
          Why does the estimated delivery time vary for each seller?
        </strong>
        <p>
          You have probably noticed varying estimated delivery times for sellers
          of the product you are interested in. Delivery times are influenced by
          product availability, geographic location of the Seller, your shipping
          destination and the courier partner's time-to-deliver in your
          location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please enter your default pin code on the product page (you don't have
          to enter it every single time) to know more accurate delivery times on
          the product page itself.
        </p>

        <strong>Seller does not/cannot ship to my area. Why?</strong>
        <p>
          Please enter your pincode on the product page (you don't have to enter
          it every single time) to know whether the product can be delivered to
          your location.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you haven't provided your pincode until the checkout stage, the
          pincode in your shipping address will be used to check for
          serviceability.
        </p>
        <p>Whether your location can be serviced or not depends on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whether the Seller ships to your location</li>
          <li>
            Legal restrictions, if any, in shipping particular products to your
            location
          </li>
          <li>
            The availability of reliable courier partners in your location
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At times Sellers prefer not to ship to certain locations. This is
          entirely at their discretion.
        </p>

        <strong>Why is the CoD option not offered in my location?</strong>
        <p>
          Availability of CoD depends on the ability of our courier partner
          servicing your location to accept cash as payment at the time of
          delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our courier partners have limits on the cash amount payable on
          delivery depending on the destination and your order value might have
          exceeded this limit. Please enter your pin code on the product page to
          check if CoD is available in your location.
        </p>
        <strong>
          I need to return an item, how do I arrange for a pick-up?

        <strong>
          What do the different tags like "In Stock", "Available" mean?
        </strong>
        <p>
          <strong>'In Stock'</strong>: For items listed as "In Stock", Sellers

          where standard courier service is available). For other areas, orders
          will be sent by Registered Post through the Indian Postal Service
          which may take 1-2 weeks depending on the location.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>'Available'</strong>: The Seller might not have the item in
          stock but can procure it when an order is placed for the item. The
          delivery time will depend on the estimated procurement time and the
          estimated shipping time to your location.
        </p>

          <strong>'Imported'</strong>: Sometimes, items have to be sourced by
          Sellers from outside India. These items are mentioned as 'Imported' on
          the product page and can take at least 10 days or more to be delivered
          to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>'Back In Stock Soon'</strong>: The item is popular and is sold
