                        For any products for which a refund is to be given, the refund will

                        seller.

                    <p>Part 3 - General Rules for a successful Return:</p>

                    <p>
                        In certain cases where the seller is unable to process a replacement
                        for any reason whatsoever, a refund will be given.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In cases where a product accessory is found
                        missing/damaged/defective, the seller may either process a
                        replacement of the particular accessory or issue an eGV for an
                        amount equivalent to the price of the accessory, at the seller’s
                        discretion.

                    <p>
                        During open box deliveries, while accepting your order, if you
                        received a different or a damaged product, you will be given a
                        refund (on the spot refunds for cash-on-delivery orders). Once you
                        have accepted an open box delivery, no return request will be
                        processed, except for manufacturing defects. In such cases, these
                        category-specific replacement/return general conditions will be
                        applicable. <a href="#">Click here</a> to know more about Open Box
